Design Decisions Made:
- Since it is a landing page for a specific demographic, I haven't included a lot of information and kept it at the bare minimum so that the conversion rate is higher
- I used Angular with routing for building the app and Bootstrap 3 for styling
- Since the download page and the home page for the app lead to the downloads page, I believe it will entice the user to download the app. Hence I have added multiple routes to the same location as that is the main CTA
- Preview gives a glimpse of how the weather app looks for today, weekly and hourly basis. I have reused styling across the different elements so that they can be reused
